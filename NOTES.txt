em.greentea {}
	- <em> that belongs to greentea class. <em class="greentea"> */

class = "blue green red"
	- During tiebreaker, when specificity doesn't matter, the order that properties are written in decides the font color.
	- If .green is last class in css file in chronology of .blue .green and .red classes, then the code will output font specified in .green class

Monospace: best for coding examples/displays on websites (every character follows same parameters)

@fontface { 
	font-family: "Emblema One";
	src: "url"
} 

#fff == #ffffff
#a0e == #aa00ee

rgba(): a stands for alpha; transparancy
a=10 in decimal;
b=11
c=12
d=13
e=14
f=15
10=16
11=17

#33C0DE (num 0 NOT 'O')
(3*16) + 3 = 51
(12*16) + 0 = 192
(13*16) + 14 = 222

lower number = darker shade
higher number = lighter shade

"_self" = same page
"_blank" = open in new tab

text-align: center;
	- Controls inline elements: if used on a div, the nested div's inline-elements would be cetnered.
	

CASCADE: TIEBREAKER
	- Author 
	- User
	- number of Id's
	- number of classes
	- number of element names (em, p, body)
	- order that rules are placed
	- THEN look up

Extra space between margins:
	- When two margins touch, the bigger margin is assigned to both elements.
	so 10 and 20 margins touch, instead of 30 you'd get 20
	- nested margins act differently, too.

Float:
	- Only in-line content respects the borders of floated elements
	- clear: right; on an element that 's adjacent to a floating element
	means "I don't want you floating on me to the right" and so the element will push down
